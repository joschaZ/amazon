Cost is less, but that's because aluminum is cheaper and more resistive than copper.  I work as an engineer for a power company.  Lower voltage distribution power lines used to often be made from pure copper - however it is more cost effective to use aluminum or aluminum alloys... but since the resistance is greater for these wires, the wire gauge is increased - so you need thicker wires to accomplish the same thing...however this is more cost effective.  Same theory applies here...it's not pure copper, so ideally - you should use bigger wire than what your application would require if pure copper was used.<br /><br />General rule for 16 AWG wire is to keep runs at 48' or less.  Most runs aren't that long, so 16 AWG will even satisfy most short wire installs... having said that, if you purchase the 14 AWG CCA wire - I'd imagine runs of wire up to 50' would be acceptable.<br /><br />Some reasons to shop around include corrosion resistance found in oxygen free coppers.. The other issue is unlike my power industry example, this product isn't necessarily cost effective if you know where to shop...pure copper from bigger bargain sites (or even 12 AWG lamp cord from a local hardware store) are priced about the same as a roll of this 14 AWG wire sells for.  So....having said that, you might as well purchase a better quality product given the same cost and a choice between the two.
I am no pro but I can say that I can not tell the difference between this speaker cable and the more expensive stuff. I've been doing this sort of thing for many years and always used the more expensive cables but a friend, who is in the business, told me recently that copper wire is copper wire, no matter what company you buy it from and as long as the wire is shielded properly, why pay more? Made sense to me so I tried it and guess what? He was right! I don't have test devices to check OHM loss and all that stuff, only my ear and my ear tells me I can't tell the difference at any volume or range. Never too old to learn something new!
RCA AH14100SN 100 Ft. 14-Gauge Speaker Wire Watch out.. It may not suit your needs. It is not copper wire so if you are installing it anywhere that will require bends it may end up breaking on you. The description does not say that it is aluminium wire.. In my case it was not even Copper Clad wire. Also it was not even 100 ft long (more about 60 ft). Description of item is lacking or quality is going down on the product.
If you're thinking this looks like a good buy for 14 gauge wire, be aware that this is copper-coated wire, not full braided copper! I would much rather direct you to Monoprice where you can get pure copper 12 guage wire for roughly the same price.<br /><br />Do not buy this wire!
These wires worked great.  One wire has a stripe on it so you can tell them apart.
I recently purchased 16 gauge RCA speaker wire through Amazon and connected my home theater speakers with it.  The sound quality is great and the price was also.  I would highly recommend this wire to those of you who want great sound for a great value...Thank you Amazon!!

I bought 14 and 18 guage wire to make sure I was getting the right wire. I used the 14 for the longer wire pulls (greater than 12 feet) and 16 guage for the shorter 10' pulls. I didn't use the 18 guage at all. The wire has 2 (two) different colored wires, one silver the other is gold. I used some great banana plugs that screw on from a company called Sewell, the plugs were on sale for about 5 bucks for a pack of 10.( http://www.amazon.com/Pair-Banana-Plugs-Screw-Connectors/dp/B003EGIE2S/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1288442903&sr=8-3-fkmr0 ) I installed surround sound 7.1 speakers 8 (speakers).The banana plugs make changing the receiver around so much easier, you don't have to un-screw the speaker wires so much. The sound is great, it's so realistic, it fools my dog. Technology today has change so much, but speaker wire is still so important. You can't cheap out on speaker wire. That doesn't mean you have to buy super expensive wire. Amazon had/has the best price for great cable, they beat the big box stores prices and quality hands down. Everything I ordered came days before it was promised. Amazon does a great job even if the products are dropped shipped. When people ask what I want for my birthday or xmas I tell'm give me a card from Amazon, i'll find something there. Great store, great products, great prices.<br /><br />Dan Hux<br />Raleigh, NC
At time of purchase, was BEST price for true 14 gauge speaker wire (CAUTION: cheaper brands may be deceptive and count the wire coating with the wire as the guage size- VERY deceptive)<br /><br />PROS:<br />- True 14 gauge (if you need this gauge for the length of your particular run)<br />- Well marked polarity<br />- No nonsense quality wire (read reviews about physics of electric current etc and realize the low oxygen, super shielded, etc are just that- hyped marketing.  i.e. Wouldn't buy Monster wire or cables unless your friends check out your brands and measure the height of your ceilings on the second floor to make sure you didn't go cheap.)<br /><br />CONS:<br />- As another reviewer noted could be marked every foot for measurement purposes (this was not important to me).
First, I can confirm that the actual product does not look like what is pictured in the official Amazon photo, as the wire now has a bright, continuous white line on the jacket of one of the wires.  The other wire includes occasion black printing "RCA 14AWG SPEAKER WIRE" on it.<br /><br />Second, I can confirm that the product is copper clad aluminum, not copper.  If you look carefully through all of the reviews, you will note that the earlier iterations of the RCA speaker wire used to be 100% oxygen free copper.  Not any more.  Apparently with copper prices skyrocketing, it was no longer cost-effective to provide 100% copper wiring.  Now, I'm not one of those audio enthusiasts that insists higher end wire sounds better, however, it is known that aluminum wiring has almost double the electrical resistance of copper wiring (recall Ohm's Law where voltage = current * resistance), so achieving consistency of your wiring is important).<br /><br />Third, this wire is much more rigid (like thick lamp wire), in contrast to earlier versions of the true copper wire, which was much easier to bend.<br /><br />Is this wire sonically inferior to the earlier wiring? I cannot say, but for other reasons, the earlier wiring was easier to work with, and was just worth more.  However, you can get other 14awg lamp wire or speaker wire for much less (e.g. http://www.amazon.com/Pyramid-RSW14100-Gauge-Quality-Speaker/dp/B0007DBBJY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1327474157&sr=8-1) so this wire is no longer a good deal in its copper clad aluminum iteration.
Save your money and buy this. Dont pay for monsters advertising......Have bought them many times after falling for all the hype. Nonsense, these are quality and a great value.
There's not much to say about this speaker cable except that it works as advertised.  This was the perfect amount to configure a 5.1 setup in my small living room.  The cable is thick (definitely appears to be 16-Gauge) and it works.  No complaints, especially for the price.
Bought these to use with a new pair of Sony 120w speakers. The wire they come with just feels too thin to be able to deliver 120w of sound.<br /><br />The sound quality, even at low levels, is very much noticeably improved by these wires (had stock on one, and these on the other). Also I just love the flat wire design. Hides easily under anything.<br /><br />These are very easy to strip as well, not once did I have to restart because I cut a strand. With a knife, slit the clear edges of the casing, and score the casing in-between on both sides. Twist if off, and you're done.
Unless you need it for outside and need a thicker coated wire....this wire will do you just fine.  there is no reason to pay for name brand wire (like monster cable ect.) Underneath the conduit insulation it is still just copper wire.  I bought this wire for my 15 yr old sons system we just got for his bday. He was worried because his friend had monster cable, so borrowed some monster cable from a friand to compare with this wire and we could not tell the difference.  Him and his friends were impressed and his friend who we borrowed the cable from was dissappointed he spent so much money on the wire he bought.
Do a search for &#34;copper speaker wire 14 gauge&#34; on Amazon and this is the fourth product that shows up. The first three are all oxygen-free copper. I wanted copper but didn't feel I needed oxygen-free so I bought this.<br /><br />It's copper-clad aluminum, not copper, but it doesn't say that in the product specs. I didn't figure it out until I cut some. I feel defrauded by Amazon, not intentionally but through their carelessness. They should fix their search algorithm and require proper specifications on the product page.<br /><br />As others have said this will work OK in short runs. However it is not the product I thought I was buying.
nice, high strand count. been using for a month with a new polk tl1600 setup and it sounds great. wire ran under the carpet and pad, there is a noticeable bump, but not as bad as normal speaker wire.  wire is coded for polarity on the sleeve.  fairly easy to strip the end with a razor blade by slicing 4 sides and then pulling off (with pliers is needed).  added more photo for you to look at.</span></div><div id="R1MLGPXMQVOZTK_imageSection_main" class="a-section a-spacing-medium a-spacing-top-medium review-image-container"><div class="review-image-tile-section">
Nothing special about this wire, marked white on one side. the casing is pretty thick. The wires on inside are really thin. its pretty easy to cut through the wire if youre not careful.  sound fine, no complaints. good price. would recommend these.

This is excellent wire; unlike some others, it is actually the gauge on the label.  Good, heavy copper stranded wire protected by a clear and strong plastic sheathing.  And it is priced fairly and honestly.  I think it is the least expensive 14 gauge speaker wire here, but it is as good as the most expensive (which are mind-bogglingly overpriced and hyped like the snake oil medicines of the 19th century).  Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, Dorothy, our gazillion dollar speaker wire will even clear up your acne and make you better in bed...  Sheesh.  If only we had cared about education, maybe those con men would be unable to get rich selling their ridiculous speaker wire. Buy this wire.  Enjoy the music and the money you saved by doing so.
Some of the best speaker wire I have ever used.<br />By far the best wire for solder connection. I do believe it is copper clad aluminum, it must be a high quality pure copper coating. Not at all like the low quality copper alloy used in our domestic made speaker wire.<br />Full length polarity marking on the wire and nice and flexible for the size wire.<br />My wire came with a broken spool and most of the wire just laying in the box. The box showed no sign of damage and the multimeter in the box was not damaged so I feel Amazon packer did the damage while packing the box.<br />I can't fault the product for the carelessness of some of Amazons people in shipping.
I couldn't believe the price on this speaker wire.  I was setting up a home theater system for my parents and they wanted to run some speaker wires under the carpet before their new carpet got installed.  I wanted 16 gauge speaker wire since the rear speakers were about 20 feet away from the receiver.  I went to Lowe's and they wanted almost $70 for comparable 100ft. 16 gauge cable.  I got the cable and paid the $4 to have it over-nighted (definite benefit of Amazon Prime account when you need it) and it still only cost me $22.  The speaker wire has a white line on one side to help you connect the positive and negative connectors on your receiver and speakers so you keep the polarity correct.  A lot of expensive speaker wires seem to be going away with this and making it more difficult to connect your devices.  Great speaker wire for the price.  I would definitely buy again when needed.
This cable is great. Easy to cut, easy to strip, long, and sturdy. Hooked up my speakers in no time and they sound great. These go for (exactly) five times as much at microcenter which is ridiculous. Buy this cable and you won't regret it. I don't think you can get a higher quality speaker cable without going above $50 at this length and, honestly, who can hear the difference?!

Included were&nbsp;<a class="a-link-normal" href="/AmazonBasics/dp/B006LW0W5Y">AmazonBasics</a>,<a class="a-link-normal" href="/RCA/dp/B0029HO66G">RCA </a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a class="a-link-normal" href="/C-E/dp/B00APEG9MO">C&E</a>, the first two are copper clad and the third is pure OFC.<br /><br />I convinced an associate of mine to allow the testing to be done at his facility, which only cost me some  time in repair work that he needed done and some lively conversation over a sip of Gentleman Jack when we were finished.<br /><br />I then lovingly created 6 foot and 30 foot cables of each wire and set out. This engineer's control room is certainly adequate for testing speaker wire.<br /><br />It's built with no right angles, it uses dual density walls and floor and has bass traps and foam strategically placed to listen in front of his console. We used his mid-field monitors, which are Bag End MM8's that are powered by a Crown Reference 2 amp at about 350 wpc, pretty nice equipment.<br /><br />We compared the wires against his own, against each other and in the different lengths. We listened to tracks in mono, we listened to samples, we tried drum tracks and piano.<br /><br />We both agreed that there was a tiny difference in sound between his $250 cables and 30 feet of 16 gauge. We also agreed that 6 feet of 16 gauge made no difference. But we also couldn't say that the change in sound was bad, only that we thought that it did change.<br /><br />The real problem came when we tried to decide about the extremes. Using 6 feet of pure OFC and 30 feet of copper clad or the opposite. Neither of us felt positive that there was any difference. We called in a third pair of ears and they were simply asked to listen to a song in mono through each speaker with the ability to turn either speaker off. But they were not told why. When asked if they sounded the same they said " Of course it did, it was the same song from the same speakers, why wouldn't it?". Okay....<br /><br />People can buy whatever product that they choose to. I'm satisfied that at up to 30 feet, the cheapest 16 gauge's sound quality is adequate. There would also be little reason for many not to spend 2 ½ times more on pure OFC, because it's still not a lot of money for some to spend, I would spend more for longer lengths because I always have. If you try to break the wires with repetitive bending, copper clad will break before pure copper, but it takes a lot of bending.<br /><br />After testing in a designed room using studio grade equipment, I think it unlikely that the equipment that most use in the listening area's that they listen to it, is going to show any recognizable difference with upgraded speaker wire.<br /><br />But possibly the most interesting thing was that in the one setup that we were sure was different, 30 feet of copper clad and his pro cables, I couldn't say anything about better or worse, only slightly different. If he used cheap wire, no one would walk in and say that his system sounded bad.<br /><br />Now you know what I know.<br /><br />I have no recommendation for you because I understand that some people do not believe that advertising is purchased by a product seller to get you to buy their product, some enjoy infomercials and some just go with the flow. So the decision is completely yours.<br /><br />I would say to you that of all the equipment and wiring used in audio reproduction...That as long as you follow common sense rules, speaker wire may be the least important piece of it by several times over.<br /><br />The reason for this wires 4 star rating is because I purchased a 50 foot roll, which was a poor value, 100 feet would change that and if you want 14 gauge copper clad this could be your best value and 5 stars.
Sent mine back. Your need real copper wiring to get the best sound from your equipment. Copper Covered Aluminum does not do the job.
I used to have the expensive major brand cables to hook up my speakers, but when we moved to a new house I needed longer runs. To save on some of the cost I purchased this instead of the "name brand" speaker cable and I can not tell the difference.
I install home theater systems for a living an always use this brand and gauge wire. There is never a need to spend more for anything marketed for "home theater" use or "THX Certification." This is a true 16 gauge wire, with a thick, yet soft and flexible sheath providing great resistance to interference as well as durability. Wire count is very high which allows for strong connections and great audio quality in high powered systems. I'll never use anything else for customer applications, and my personal use.
