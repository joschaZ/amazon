stated
this

Cost

but
that's
because
aluminum
cheaper
and
more

than
copper
work
engineer
for
power
company
Lower
voltage
distribution
power
lines
used
often
made
from
pure
copper
however
more
cost
effective
use
aluminum
aluminum
alloys
but
since
the
resistance
greater
for
these
wires
the
wire
gauge
increased
you
need
thicker
wires
accomplish
the
same
thing
however
this
more
cost
effective
Same
theory
applies
here
it's
not
pure
copper
ideally
you
should
use
bigger
wire
than
what
your
application
would
require
pure
copper
was
used
General
rule
for
AWG
wire
keep
runs
less
Most
runs
aren't
that
long
AWG
will
even
satisfy
most
short
wire
installs
having
said
that
you
purchase
the
AWG
CCA
wire
I'd
imagine
runs
wire
would
acceptable
Some
reasons
shop
around
include
corrosion
resistance
found
oxygen
free
coppers
The
other
issue
unlike
power
industry
example
this
product
isn't
necessarily
cost
effective
you
know
where
shop
pure
copper
from
bigger
bargain
sites
even
AWG
lamp
cord
from
local
hardware
store
are
priced
about
the
same
roll
this
AWG
wire
sells
for
having
said
that
you
might
well
purchase
better
quality
product
given
the
same
cost
and
choice
between
the
two

This
the
scenario
I'm
audio
engineer
and
purchased
three
popular
speaker
wires
gauge
from
amazon
Included
were

C-E
B00APEG9MO
the
first
two
are
copper
clad
and
the
third
pure
OFC
convinced
associate
mine
allow
the
testing
done
his
facility
which
only
cost
some
time
repair
work
that
needed
done
and
some
lively
conversation
over
sip
Gentleman
Jack
when
were
finished
then
lovingly
created
foot
and
foot
cables
each
wire
and
set
out
This
engineer's
control
room
certainly
adequate
for
testing
speaker
wire
It's
built
with
right
angles
uses
dual
density
walls
and
floor
and
has
bass
traps
and
foam
strategically
placed
listen
front
his
console
used
his
mid-field
monitors
which
are
Bag
End
MM8
that
are
powered
Crown
Reference
amp
about
350
wpc
pretty
nice
equipment
compared
the
wires
against
his
own
against
each
other
and
the
different
lengths
listened
tracks
mono
listened
samples
tried
drum
tracks
and
piano
both
agreed
that
there
was
tiny
difference
sound
between
his
$250
cables
and
feet
gauge
also
agreed
that
feet
gauge
made
difference
But
also
couldn't
say
that
the
change
sound
was
bad
only
that
thought
that
did
change
The
real
problem
came
when
tried
decide
about
the
extremes
Using
feet
pure
OFC
and
feet
copper
clad
the
opposite
Neither
felt
positive
that
there
was
any
difference
called
third
pair
ears
and
they
were
simply
asked
listen
song
mono
through
each
speaker
with
the
ability
turn
either
speaker
off
But
they
were
not
told
why
When
asked
they
sounded
the
same
they
said
course
did
was
the
same
song
from
the
same
speakers
why
wouldn't
Okay
People
can
buy
whatever
product
that
they
choose
I'm
satisfied
that
feet
the
cheapest
gauge's
sound
quality
adequate
There
would
also
little
reason
for
many
not
spend
times
more
pure
OFC
because
it's
still
not
lot
money
for
some
spend
would
spend
more
for
longer
lengths
because
always
have
you
try
break
the
wires
with
repetitive
bending
copper
clad
will
break
before
pure
copper
but
takes
lot
bending
After
testing
designed
room
using
studio
grade
equipment
think
unlikely
that
the
equipment
that
most
use
the
listening
area's
that
they
listen
going
show
any
recognizable
difference
with
upgraded
speaker
wire
But
possibly
the
most
interesting
thing
was
that
the
one
setup
that
were
sure
was
different
feet
copper
clad
and
his
pro
cables
couldn't
say
anything
about
better
worse
only
slightly
different
used
cheap
wire
one
would
walk
and
say
that
his
system
sounded
bad
Now
you
know
what
know
have
recommendation
for
you
because
understand
that
some
people
not
believe
that
advertising
purchased
product
seller
get
you
buy
their
product
some
enjoy
infomercials
and
some
just
with
the
flow
the
decision
completely
yours
would
say
you
that
all
the
equipment
and
wiring
used
audio
reproduction
That
long
you
follow
common
sense
rules
speaker
wire
may
the
least
important
piece
several
times
over
The
reason
for
this
wires
star
rating
because
purchased
foot
roll
which
was
poor
value
100
feet
would
change
that
and
you
want
gauge
copper
clad
this
could
your
best
value
and
stars
